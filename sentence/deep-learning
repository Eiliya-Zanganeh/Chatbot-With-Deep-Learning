What is the application of deep learning?
---
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence the term "deep"). These deep neural networks can learn from large amounts of data with minimal human supervision, enabling them to identify complex patterns and make decisions or predictions.
Hey there! Deep learning is a fascinating field in artificial intelligence that involves training artificial neural networks to learn and make decisions on their own. These neural networks are inspired by the human brain's structure and function.
